# Academic Dictionary (in-progress)

A single central location for important academic terms and jargon sorted by academic field.

## Description

The motivation for this was to create a source for finding the meaning, origin of, and notable uses of academic terms that you might search for when reading a paper in a field that you are not familiar with (or even in fields you are!). While wikipedia currently can serve in this function to a small degree, this would do a much better job of making it really easy for students in particular to have a useful grasp on the background of an unfamiliar term when reading a paper or engaging in class discussion.

## Technologies Used
